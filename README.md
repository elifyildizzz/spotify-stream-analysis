### Spotify Data Analysis & Stream Prediction

This project dives into the most streamed songs on Spotify, applying data science techniques to explore patterns and predict streaming success.

##### Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess Spotify data
- Perform descriptive analysis (top artists, average features, year-wise distribution)
- Explore correlations between musical features and stream counts
- Build predictive models (Linear Regression & Random Forest)
- Tune hyperparameters for optimal model performance

##### Techniques Used

- Pandas & NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

##### Key Analyses

- The 10 Most Listened Songs
- The 10 Artists With the Most Songs
- Correlation heatmaps of features
- Regression models to estimate stream counts
- Feature importance rankings

##### Predictive Models

- **Linear Regression**: for baseline estimation
- **Ridge Regression**: with alpha tuning
- **Random Forest**: for improved performance with tuning

##### Dataset Source
